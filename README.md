Web Scraping Telegram Bot - Urban Dictionary (@urbandictionary_slangbot)

This project was created to demonstrate the use of the BeautifulSoup library
and its integration with ever popular Telegram Bot API. 

In this particular example I will be making a Telegram Bot, which will take 
text input, that will be used to search a word in the directory on the website 
and it's dictionary definition scraped from the resulting page. This definition 
would be then sent as a response to the input in the telegrams dialogue window. 

In case the word is not listed in the dictionary, the resulting message response
in the dialogue window will indicate error.
